# Pixel Blue

This repository is based on Universal Blue's official template and built as a Fedora Silverblue image for Pixelbook.

This repository includes verified solutions from [WeirdTreeThing](https://github.com/WeirdTreeThing) and other respected contributors.

Please note that this is just an experimental project; use it at your own risk.

# How to Use

There are several ways for Pixelbook users to install this image on their device or just switch from another Universal Blue-based OS.

## Option 1: Install Pixel Blue from ISO file (Not ready yet.)



## Option 2: Switch to Pixel Blue

Pixel Blue is published in three channels. Pick the one you want and use the matching command.

### Latest channel (default)

`latest` follows the upstream Universal Blue `latest` image and always tracks the newest Fedora.

``` bash
sudo bootc switch ghcr.io/zhchmmx/pixel-blue:latest
```

### Testing channel

`testing` is the preview channel for `latest`. It is built from the same upstream `latest` base, so it only differs by the changes that are being validated before they land in `latest`. Use it if you want to test upcoming changes early.

``` bash
sudo bootc switch ghcr.io/zhchmmx/pixel-blue:testing
```


### Pinning to a specific build

Every build is also published with a commit-based tag, so you can freeze to an exact build:

``` bash
sudo bootc switch ghcr.io/zhchmmx/pixel-blue:latest-<commit>
```

After that, you may reboot your device to see the changes. Users on a moving channel (`latest` or `testing`) are updated automatically; users pinned to a commit tag will not receive updates until they switch back to a channel.

> For maintainers: `latest` is built from the `main` branch and `testing` from the `testing` branch. To roll a change out, commit it on `testing`, verify the published `testing` image, then merge `testing` into `main` to promote it to `latest`.

# Suspend and Sleep (S3 vs Modern Standby)

By default this image uses the kernel's `s2idle` (Modern Standby) suspend path,
which keeps most of the platform powered. On the Pixelbook that shows up as fast
lid-close drain — the battery can drop noticeably overnight. ChromeOS itself uses
a deeper suspend, so if you want standby behaviour closer to it, you can opt into
S3 (suspend-to-RAM). This is left as a user choice; the image does not force
either mode.

## Enabling S3 (lower standby drain)

S3 is selected at the firmware level, which cannot be baked into the image:

1. Reboot into the UEFI firmware settings.
2. Disable **Modern Standby (S0ix)**; the system then falls back to S3 (deep).
3. Boot Linux and verify as shown below.

Keep Modern Standby instead if you value instant resume and background
network/notifications over low standby drain — that is a valid trade-off, just
expect higher lid-close power draw.

# Modifications to the Upstream

- Add audio support from [WeirdTreeThing](https://github.com/WeirdTreeThing).
- Add keymap via [keyd](https://github.com/rvaiya/keyd).
- Add RPM Fusion (free + nonfree) plus full multimedia codecs: complete `ffmpeg`, the GStreamer plugin set (including `bad-freeworld` and `ugly` from RPM Fusion), and full VA-API hardware decoding. AAC and HEVC (8/10-bit) decode is accelerated on the Pixelbook's Kaby Lake iGPU via `intel-media-driver` (iHD, swapped in from RPM Fusion nonfree, with the legacy `i965` driver kept as fallback); check it with `vainfo`.
- Improve Pixelbook Pen support.
- Improve auto brightness via [wluma](https://github.com/max-baz/wluma). (In progress)
- Add [Waydroid](https://waydro.id/) (Android in a container) from the Fedora repos.

# Waydroid First-Time Setup

The Waydroid packages are baked into the image, but the Android system image is not pre-downloaded. On first use, run:

``` bash
sudo waydroid init
```

This downloads the LineageOS-based Android system image (choose the variant you want when prompted). Afterwards start the container and launch it:

``` bash
sudo systemctl start waydroid-container
waydroid session start
waydroid show-full-ui
```
